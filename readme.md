# TD(Î») Learning on 1D Random Walk 
This project implemented the experiments of Sutton's paper on "Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences". All the implementations can be found in replicating_TD_lambda_sutton_1988.ipynb. A ".py" python script version is also available.  
## Running the experiments
### Step One
Before doing any experiment, run all the cells up to the "1 Experiments" markdown cell to activate the libraries, global variable, and function definitions. 
### To run experiment for Sutton's Figure 3
For the experiment on unconstrained dataset, run the cell below the "1.1 Experiment Figure 3" markdown. For the experiment on balanced dataset, run the cell below "1.1.1 Balanced train set" markdown. Note: this experiment may take a while to run. The approximate run time is 15 minutes.   
### To run experiment for Sutton's Figure 4
First of all, run the cell below the "2 Experiment Figure 4&5" markdown, then run the cells below the "2.1 Experiment Figure 4" markdown. The approximate run time is 10 minutes. 
### To run experiment for Sutton's Figure 5
First of all, run the cell below the "2 Experiment Figure 4&5" markdown, then run the cells below the "2.2 Experiment Figure 5" markdown. The approximate run time is 10 minutes.
